  aboutMe:
    "Hello! I'm Abigail Lopez, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a co-major in English. As I step into the exciting world of technology, I'm fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a deep love for learning. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege of working with Java, Python, and C#, languages that have not only become tools in my toolkit but also sources of fascination and endless possibilities. I've had the pleasure of working on projects that merge technology and creativity, such as developing games using Python's Pygame library and crafting virtual reality (VR) prototypes in Unity. These experiences have reinforced my belief that technology can be a canvas for artistic expression, and I'm eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible. As I prepare to take the next step in my career, I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects that leverage technology to create captivating and meaningful experiences. I'm equally eager to connect with professionals who share my enthusiasm for technology, creativity, and collaboration.",
